    "# Reasoning without Observation\n",
    "ReWOO proposes an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:\n",
    "1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. _(ReACT style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step)_\n",
    "2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory)"

route to creating a break point opportunity, which Medvedev snuffed out with trademark patience, drawing a forehand error from his opponent. “We are trying to get better every day, even during the
