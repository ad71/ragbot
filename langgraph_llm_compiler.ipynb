For instance, `math(\"1 + 3, 2 + 4\")` does not work. If you need to calculate multiple expressions, you need to call them separately like `math(\"1 + 3\")` and then `math(\"2 + 4\")`\\n - Minimize the number of `math` actions as much as possible. For instance, instead of calling 2. math(\"what is the 10% of $1\") and then call 3. math(\"$1 + $2\"), you MUST call 2. math(\"what is the 110% of $1\") instead, which will reduce the number of math actions.\\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\\n - `math` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`.You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do math on it.\\n - You MUST NEVER provide `search` type action\\'s outputs as a variable in the `problem` argument. This is because `search` returns a text blob that contains the information about the entity, not a number or value. Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `search` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `math` action. For example, 1. search(\"Barack Obama\") and then 2. math(\"age of $1\") is NEVER allowed. Use 2. math(\"age of Barack Obama\", context=[\"$1\"]) instead.\\n - When you ask a question about `context`, specify the units.
